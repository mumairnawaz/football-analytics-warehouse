## Background

Elite football competitions generate substantial commercial value through broadcasting rights, sponsorships, and global fan engagement. However, leagues differ significantly in competitiveness, scoring behavior, and team dominance.

This project moves beyond basic match statistics to address business-critical questions, including:

How competitive are top football leagues in reality?

Are league outcomes driven by a small number of elite teams?

How predictable is goal scoring across competitions?

Where do structural advantages exist?

The analysis focuses on delivering decision-oriented insights, not descriptive statistics.

## Executive Summary

This project evaluates UEFA Champions League, Premier League, and LaLiga performance across the 2024–2025 seasons using a purpose-built analytics warehouse.

Key Findings:

Scoring intensity and volatility vary meaningfully by competition

Home advantage remains a structural factor, not a seasonal anomaly

A small set of elite teams disproportionately influence league outcomes

Competitive balance differs sharply across leagues

The project delivers decision-ready KPIs, enabling strategic insight for:

League operators

Broadcasters

Club management

Football analysts

This is a business analytics project, not a fan-driven analysis.

## Project Objective

The primary objectives of this project are to:

Build a scalable football analytics warehouse

Standardize performance metrics across competitions

Produce business-focused KPIs to support strategic decision-making

This is not a dashboard-only project — it demonstrates end-to-end analytics ownership, from ingestion to insight.



Data Architecture & Methodology

A medallion-style analytics architecture was implemented to ensure reliability, auditability, and scalability.

🔹 Bronze Layer – Raw Ingestion

Raw match data ingested from official football data sources

Stored without transformation for full traceability

🔹 Silver Layer – Clean & Standardized

Data cleaning and normalization

Standardized team names and match structures

Consistent season and competition alignment

🔹 Gold Layer – Business Analytics

Match-level fact tables

Aggregated KPIs by competition, season, and team

Optimized for SQL analytics and BI consumption

This mirrors enterprise data warehouse design, not ad-hoc analysis.
